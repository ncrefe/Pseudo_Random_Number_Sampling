# Pseudo_Random_Number_Sampling
Expected to generate a random variable X which has the following cumulative distribution
function: 𝐹(𝑥) = 𝑥2 , 𝑓𝑜𝑟 0 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 1

a) Create 50000 samples of X using the Inverse Transformation method. At each step, store the
generated variables u, x and the updated average and variance of X in the given arrays.
At the end:
- Plot the average value of X that you calculated throughout the experiment as Figure 4.
- Plot the variance of X that you calculated throughout the experiment as Figure 5.

b) Create 50000 samples of X using the Rejection method. At each step, store the generated
variable x and the updated average and variance of X in the given arrays.
At the end:
- Plot the average value of X that you calculated throughout the experiment as Figure 8.
- Plot the variance of X that you calculated throughout the experiment as Figure 9.
